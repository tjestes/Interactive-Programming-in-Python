Interactive Programming in Python through Coursera/Rice University

These are all the mini projects I completed for part I of the Coursera course 'Interactive programming in Python'. Navigate to CodeSkulptor.org and copy in the code from these mini projects as their are some modules that were custom built for CodeSkulptor.
